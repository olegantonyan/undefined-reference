![MyPhoto](/assets/me.jpg) Software engineer and entrepreneur, love Open Source and startups. For some years worked on [embedded devices](http://antlabs.herokuapp.com/pages/portfolio){:target="_blank"}, hardcore `C`, `C++`, mobile and now landed at web and `Ruby`. Now working full-time in [startup](https://10levels.ru/){:target="_blank"} as a lead backend developer. Also I'm working with a partner on our own [project](http://slon-ds.ru/){:target="_blank"}.

In this blog you may find useful stuff about programming and especially in `Ruby`. As a developer I find a lot of useful articles in people's blogs. So, why not me if I have something to share?

You may find me on social media. Feel free to ask for help or anything else.
