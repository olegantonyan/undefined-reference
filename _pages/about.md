![MyPhoto](/assets/me.jpg) Software engineer since 2010s. Started with embedded development for 8 and 32-bits microcontrollers in `C`, `C++`, then mobile and now landed at `Ruby` and data engineering.

In this blog you may find useful stuff about programming. As a developer I find a lot of useful articles in people's blogs. So, why not me if I have something to share?

You may find me on social media. Feel free to ask for help or anything else.
